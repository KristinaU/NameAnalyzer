# NameAnalyzer
Analysing your origin by your name

Created with SwiftUI, has ViewModel and Network Layer.
For country decoding using ISO country decoder from Funcy Monkey, thanks to them.

For the time being does not show correct countries in the View,
however, the Array is OK, that you can check in the print output.

Thank you.
